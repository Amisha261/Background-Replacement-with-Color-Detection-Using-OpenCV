# Background Replacement with Color Detection Using OpenCV

# Overview

This repository contains a Python notebook that implements the invisibility cloak effect using OpenCV. By detecting a specific color in video frames (commonly red), the program replaces that area with the background, making it appear invisible — a fun and visually engaging computer vision project.

# Contents

1. invisible.ipynb — Jupyter Notebook with the full implementation of the invisible cloak effect using OpenCV.

2. requirements.txt — List of Python libraries required to run the notebook.

# Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required python libraries from requirments.txt
3. Open the invisible.ipynb on your system and run the file

# Results
This project captures the static background and detects red-colored regions in live video. These regions are masked and replaced with the captured background, creating a visual effect where the object appears invisible on screen.

# Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas, enhancements, or bug fixes, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

# Acknowledgment
This project was inspired by popular OpenCV tutorials and online computer vision learning resources. Special thanks to the OpenCV community for their extensive documentation and support.
